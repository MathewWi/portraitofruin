!! Comments

First of all, see the [2255S|submission text of previous run] for informations about general tricks.

The core of the run is luck manipulation. This game has three RNG objects, one of them is used for
enemy drops, other one is mainly used for enemy moves, and the rest is mainly used for visual effects.
While playing the game, enemy drops changes only when you kill an enemy. That's definitely hard to manipulate.
However, all those RNGs are reset according to a frame counter when you load a save file.

Therefore, we tried to delay loading save file three times, because

# To get Axe and Summon Zombie ability, which makes killing Persephones and Final Guard faster (82 delay frames added)
# To get Frilly Camisole, -TODO- I don't know why :P (no delay frames added, we were lucky)
# To get Final Sword, the strongest sword in the game (76 delay frames added)

It's quite hard to manipulate them, so that gocha has written a Lua script which emulates RNG and writes its output to RAM.
This allows to us find a good value without rewinding the movie to the  save selection screen for each try.
